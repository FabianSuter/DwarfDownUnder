## Info

## Declarations & Sources

### General
- This game was developed with the [MonoGame framework](https://monogame.net/)
- The majority of the MonoGameLibrary is from one of the [tutorials](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/tutorials/index.html)
- To handle Tiled maps (see below) and for other helpful additions [MonoGame Extended](https://docs.monogame.net/articles/tutorials/index.html) was also included

### Images
- Tileset as an asset pack from [lyime](https://lyime.itch.io/)
    - Resized background stuff to 32x32 px (originally 16x16)
    - World building done in [Tiled editor](https://www.mapeditor.org/)
- Background in title done by myself with [LibreSprite](https://libresprite.github.io/#!/)
- UI font png done with Hiero (see below)

### Audio
- Sound Effects as a free bundle from [Kronbits](https://kronbits.itch.io/retrosfx)
- Background song theme from [Luis Zuno](https://soundcloud.com/ansimuz/tracks), currently *Exploration*

### Fonts
- ~~Sprite font from [Joël Carrouché](https://www.1001fonts.com/users/joelcarrouche/), currently *Norse Regular*~~
- Sprite font *04b_30.ttf* from [dafont.com](https://www.dafont.com/04b-30.font) 
    - (Norse Regular causes crashes so far, don't know why ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)
    - Any other font crashes, Exception throws "*fontname*_0.xnb could not be found". Searching for error hasn't helped yet.
- Fonts in UI converted from *.ttf* to *.fnt* and *.png* with [Hiero](https://docs.flatredball.com/gum/gum-tool/gum-elements/text/use-custom-font#creating-fonts-with-hiero)
